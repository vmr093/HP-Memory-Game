Memory Game
I have choosen to create a Harry Potter themed memory game in which the player has to match characters from the series. I really enjoyed the CSS portion of this game.


How to Play
link:

The user will have limited time to flip the cards. When there isn't a match, the cards will unflip and the matched sets will stay flipped. If the user does not match all the cards by the time the timer is up, they will have to resart the game.
